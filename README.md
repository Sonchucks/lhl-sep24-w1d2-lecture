# Goal

Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them.

- If any argument is not a whole number, skip it.
- Do support negative numbers though.

## Stretch

Allow the program to take a command:

- Add: Add all the numbers together
- Sub: Subtract all numbers from 0
